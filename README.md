# Gossip Website

This exercise has been made by myself and the support of my team (THP-Nice) in order to pratice MVC in Ruby on Rails. 
This exercise has been made with Postgresql and has been published on Heroku.

The aim of this website is to train about CRUD ( Create, Read, Update, Delete ) and MVC in ruby on rails.
This website allows the user to view gossips, create new gossips, edit and delete gossip, and also comment gossips.

* If you want to delete a gossip, you can do this by clicking, in the navbar, to View all gossips, then click to "View the gossip", and, you will notice a link at the bottom of the page : "Click to delete".
